									</header>
									<ul>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>What is the Jupiter United Planet (J.U.P.) ?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>J.U.P is our vision for how we can build a unique, highly productive, dynamic and synergistic community to 
											move Jupiter and crypto forward. Detailed description available <a href="https://www.jupresear.ch/t/j-u-p-an-experiment-in-
											distributed-strategic-execution/7182">Here</a></p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>What is the JUP DAO?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>The JUP DAO is a community run system of governance to develop the Jupiter Ecosystem. The DAO decides all matters around the LFG launchpad and Work Group led development initiatives. The DAO conducts votes for decentralized decision making utilizing the $JUP governance token.</p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>What is a Working Group?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>It is a small group led by key ecosystem members that guide extremely important work in areas like 
											community management, core processes and ecosystem rituals. There are multiple Working Groups in the 
											J.U.P ecosystem. The Work Group Directory can be found <a href="/workgroups.html">Here</a></p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>How can I start getting involved with working groups? </h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>To get involved with existing working groups, head over to the <a href="/workgroups.html">Working Group Directory</a>. Review the Group pages and if there are open positions within the group or they have a bounty out on work, you will find it there.</p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>How can I tell what is actively being worked on? </h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>The <a href="/blog.html">Blog</a> we host is designed to house all working group updates in a single location to make keeping up on active work in progress super easy for all DAO members. </p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>How can I participate ? </h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Join the discussions in the JUP community and learn all you can about upcoming LFG votes. When the vote goes live, be sure to go vote. The $JUP Token is required to participate in DAO votes and 1 $JUP = 1 vote. The more $JUP you vote with the more voting power you have.</p></div>	
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>What is the LFG Launchpad?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>The LFG Launchpad is a decentralized launchpad for projects to raise funds and launch their projects. The LFG Launchpad is a key component of the Jupiter Ecosystem and is governed by the JUP DAO.</p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>How to earn $JUP rewards ? </h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Jupiter's staking program, known as "ASR" (Active Staking Rewards), incentivizes users for active participation. To earn rewards, lock your $JUP on the <a href="https://vote.jup.ag/">Voting Platform</a> and vote. Rewards are earned for each vote, based on your voting power and they get distributed quarterly. Note: There are no rewards for passive staking, you must participate in each vote to get your split of the 75% of launchpad fees</p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>How do I stake my $JUP?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Staking your $JUP is easy. Head over to the <a href="https://vote.jup.ag/">Voting Platform</a> and connect your wallet. Once connected, you can control the amount of $JUP you stake and begin earning rewards with each vote you participate in. </p></div>	
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>How do I unstake my $JUP?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Unstaking your $JUP is just as easy as staking it. Head over to the <a href="https://vote.jup.ag/">Voting Platform</a> and connect your wallet. Once connected, you can control the amount of $JUP you unstake and begin the 30 day un-stake process. Note: Unstaking your $JUP will take 30 days to complete and you will be reducing your voting power linearly over that period.</p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>Where can I see my past vote activity?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Head over to the <a href="https://vote.jup.ag/">Voting Platform</a> and connect your wallet. Once connected, you can see all of your past vote activity and rewards earned for each vote. Note: You do not need to vote for the winning project in the LFG votes to get rewards, ALL participants in the votes get an equal split. </p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>When will I receive my rewards?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Rewards are distributed after the end of the Voting Period which corresponds with calendar quarters: 
											January – March (Q1), April – June (Q2), July – September (Q3) and October – December (Q4)</p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>Can I change my vote?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes, you can change your vote at any time during the voting period by navigating back to the voting page and switching your selection. Be sure to click vote again and submit the wallet transactions so it gets recorded. </p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>How will I receive my rewards ?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>$JUP rewards, when claimed, will be added directly to your existing stake accounts.
											If your JUP is staked, your JUP will increase your staked balance.
											 If your JUP is unstaking with 15 days left, the ASR rewards will also be available within 15 days
											Thus – you can begin unstaking now and it wont affect your pending rewards.
											The individual token rewards from the 75% of Launchpad fees will not be distributed immediately and will 
											likely have a minimum vesting period of 3-6 months. <a href="https://www.jupresear.ch/t/lfg-a-pragmatic-
