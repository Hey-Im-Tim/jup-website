										<div class="faq"><h2>Active Staking Rewards (ASR) FAQs</h2></div>
									</header>
									<ul>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>Will I get rewards for staking my $JUP? </h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>No, you also need to vote on the proposals to get the rewards</p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>How do I stake my $JUP?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Visit the <a href="https://vote.jup.ag/">Vote.jup.ag Site</a> and connect your wallet. Enter the amount of $JUP you wish to lock and click ‘Stake’. The $JUP will leave your wallet and be deposited into a smart contract, but can be reclaimed at any time by undergoing a 30 day unstaking process.</p></div>	
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>How do I unstake my $JUP?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Visit the <a href="https://vote.jup.ag/">Vote.jup.ag Site</a> and connect your wallet. Click on the words “Start Unstake (30D)” located below your voting power. Your $JUP tokens will unlock after 30 days, and you can still vote — however your voting power will decrease linearly until the 30 day mark.</p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>I unstaked my $JUP 30 days ago but when I try to claim it the transaction fails. What is the problem?</h3></div>
                                        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Reclaiming your $JUP requires an open token account for $JUP in your wallet. If you’ve used a wallet cleanup service, it likely closed any empty token accounts, but you can easily reopen them by buying a tiny amount of $JUP, and then you will be able to claim.</p></div>
                                        <div class="faq-question"><h3>How do I vote on a proposal?</h3></div>
                                        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Visit the voting site at <a href="https://vote.jup.ag/">Vote.jup.ag Site</a> during a live vote. Connect your wallet, scroll to the bottom where the ‘Proposals’ are listed, and click on the active measure. Then, cast your vote from among the choices.</p></div>
                                        <div class="faq-question"><h3>Can I change my vote?</h3></div>
                                        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes, connect your wallet, click on the active measure and make a new choice. The greyed out ‘Vote’ button will change color, and you can then click on it.</p></div>
                                        <div class="faq-question"><h3>Where can I see my past vote activity?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Head over to the <a href="https://vote.jup.ag/">Voting Platform</a> and connect your wallet. Once connected, you can see all of your past vote activity and rewards earned for each vote. Note: You do not need to vote for the winning project in the LFG votes to get rewards, ALL participants in the votes get an equal split. </p></div>
                                        <div class="faq-question"><h3>Will I still receive rewards if I did not vote for a winning project?</h3></div>
                                        <div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. You will always receive Active Staking Rewards no matter how you vote. Whether or not a project decides to include a BONUS airdrop is up to them.</p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>When will I receive my rewards?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Rewards are distributed quarterly, with the first batch going out in July 2024.</p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>So, will I be eligible for additional airdrops?</h3></div>
                                        <div class="faq-answer"><p>This is up to the launching projects to decide. If they wish to do an airdrop outside of the scope of ASR rewards, that is entirely up to their discretion.</p></div>
                                        <div class="faq-question"><h3>I missed earlier votes, is it too late for me to participate?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>Not at all. Rewards are distributed based on the total number of proposals and votes cast over the entire quarter, so participating in even just one proposal vote will earn you rewards. </p></div>
										<div class="faq-question"><h3>How will I receive my rewards ?</h3></div>
										<div class="faq-answer"><p>$JUP rewards, when claimed, will be added directly to your existing stake accounts.
                                            If your $JUP is staked, your staked $JUP balance will increase
                                            If your $JUP is unstaking with, for example, 15 days left, the ASR rewards will also be available in 15 days.
											The individual token rewards from the 75% of Launchpad fees will not be distributed immediately and will 
											likely have a minimum vesting period of 3-6 months.</p></div>
