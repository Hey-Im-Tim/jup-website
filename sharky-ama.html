				<h2>Vision and Goals</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Aiming for Revolution:</strong> Sharky seeks to revolutionize the Web3 space by
						embracing the peer-to-peer economy and simplifying financial transactions between individuals.

					<li><strong>Platform Focus:</strong> Currently operating on Solana, the platform primarily focuses
						on NFTs but plans to expand its offerings.</li>
					<li><strong>Measure of Success:</strong> Success for Sharky would mean making financial transactions
						as simple as using their platform, allowing easy access to capital and lending.</li>
				</ul><hr>

				<h2>Obstacles and Token Launch</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Challenges Ahead:</strong> The biggest challenges include the growth of the crypto
						space, regulatory hurdles, and resistance from existing financial institutions.</li>
					<li><strong>Token Launch Strategy:</strong> Many projects focus too much on price action and
						incentives rather than building a strong community culture when launching a token.</li>
				</ul><hr>

				<h2>Community and Ecosystem</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Building a Strong Community:</strong> Sharky emphasizes starting with a core group,
						expanding strategically, and rewarding active participation.</li>
					<li><strong>Engagement Plans:</strong> The platform has plans for an ambassador program and a secret
						DAO to further engage and reward its community.</li>
				</ul><hr>

				<h2>Real-World Assets and Future Plans</h2>
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Aiming for Liquidity:</strong> Sharky aims to be a liquidity layer for real-world
						assets, facilitating loans and mortgages without directly tokenizing or escrowing the assets.
					</li>
					<li><strong>Addressing Challenges:</strong> The platform seeks to address the challenges of
						transferring physical assets in a trustless manner and creating reliable systems for tokenizing
						and redeeming real-world assets.</li>
				</ul>

				<p><strong>Overall, Sharky is focused on building a strong, active community, simplifying access to
						financial services, and expanding its offerings to include real-world assets, all while
						navigating the challenges of the evolving crypto landscape.</strong></p><hr>
